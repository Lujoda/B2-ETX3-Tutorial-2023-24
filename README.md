# B2-ETX3-Tutorial-2023-24

This github repository serves as a support for learning programming and doing statistics in R Studio.
It is important because you will use R Studio for almost all statistical work that you will encounter in your studies.
In this module you will also have to work on a practical R assignment at the end of the course.

Completing the R tasks provided here will teach you the necessary skillset to complete such tasks and hopefully give you enough understanding to keep on learning by yourselves in the future.
These scripts do not encompass all there is to know about R but will go over the main ideas, concepts and workflow.
At the bottom you will find additional external ressources covering other aspects.

## R Scripts and tasks
The R scripts privided here consist of two parts:

1. **Demonstration** (Lecture related statistics in R)


2. **Tasks** (Learn to do the statistics in R by yourselves)

You can use the tutorial sessions to get feedback and help on this.
The tutorial sessions will be held each **monday** after the lecture:


**Lecture**: 8am-10am


**Tutorial**: 10am-12am
